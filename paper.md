# Summary
This article describes a hands-on introduction to the first steps in deep learning, 
intended for researchers who are familiar with (non-deep) machine learning.

The use of deep learning has seen a sharp increase of popularity and applicability over the last decade. 
While deep learning can be a useful tool for researchers from a wide range of domains, 
taking the first steps in the world of deep learning can be somewhat intimidating. 
This introduction aims to cover the basics of deep learning in a practical and hands-on manner, 
so that upon completion, students will be able to train their first neural network and understand 
what next steps to take to improve the model.

The lesson starts with explaining the basic concepts of neural networks, 
and then go through the different steps of a deep learning workflow. 
Learners will learn how to prepare data for deep learning, 
how to implement a basic deep learning model in Python with Keras, 
how to monitor and troubleshoot the training process and how to implement different layer types such as convolutional layers.

# Statement of Need
There are many great free online course materials on deep learning, 
for example: fast.ai's Practical Deep Learning for Coders, MORE ONLINE COURSES

Nonetheless, these resources are often not available open-source and can thus not be easily adapted to the students' needs. 
Also, the amount and diversity of the existing online courses is overwhelming, but they are generally not targeted towards academic researchers.
What works well for researchers is to both make them familiar with the key concepts, and also let them 
practice with how to implement it. Eventually resulting in a feeling of 'I can do this myself'. 
The key to getting there is live coding: Before the course learners have to setup a working environment on their own computer.
During the course learners type in the commands that are explained by the instructor on their own computer.
This ensures that learners master the programmatic implementation of deep learning at the end of the course. 

Researchers can often only free a limited amount of time (maximum 5 consecutive days), since they are so involved in their daily work.
To accomplish this, we created a lesson that can be taught in 2 consecutive days or 4 mornings.

From the feedback we gathered from students enrolled in our workshops and instructors not involved in our project we see that indeed there is a 
need for a low-threshold lesson that lets researchers take the first steps in the field of deep learning.

# Instructional design
This lesson material was designed using the concepts from the Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook (REFERENCE https://cdh.carpentries.org/).
Most importantly, we used 'backward design': We started with identifying learning objectives: the core skills and concepts that learners need to acquire as a result of the lesson.
Then, these learning objectives were used to create exercises that test whether the objectives are met.
Eventually, the content is written in such a way that it matches what learners need to learn to successfully apply these skills.

Furthermore, the lesson is built around live coding. 
The lesson is built up of small blocks. In each block first the instructor demonstrates how to do something,
and students follow along on their own computer. Then, the students work independently on exercises individually
or in groups to test their skills.

The lesson material is built in the new Carpentries lesson template (REFERENCE). 
This makes the lesson material both suited as a self-study resource, a syllabus to share with students after the workshop,
as well as lesson material for the instructor. With the 'instructor view' we even include instructor notes 
at the level of the lesson content.

The lesson is split up in a general introduction, and 3 episodes that cover 3 distinct increasingly more complex deep learning problems.
Each of the deep learning problems is approached using the same 10-step deep learning workflow.
By going through the deep learning cycle 3 times on different problems we hope that after the lesson learners will
feel confident in applying this deep learning workflow to their own work.


# Feedback
This course was taught 7 times over the course of 3 years, both online and in person, at the Netherlands eScience Center. 
**@Peter @Colin how often did you teach this at which institutes?**
Apart from the core group of contributors, the workshop was also taught at 3 independent institutes, namely:
University of Wisconson-Madison, University of Auckland, and EMBL Heidelberg.
In general, adoption of the lesson material by the instructors not involved in the project went well.

## Student responses
The feedback we gathered from students is in general very positive, further confirming our statement of need.
We use the student's feedback to continuously improve the lesson. 
Some responses from students to the question 'What was your favourite or most useful part of the workshop. Why?' further support the need for this workshop:

_I enjoyed the live coding and playing with the models to see how it would effect the results. 
It felt hands on and made it easy for me to understand the concepts._

_Well-defined steps to be followed in training a model is very useful. Examples we worked on are quite nice._

_The doing part, that really helps to get the theory into practice._
