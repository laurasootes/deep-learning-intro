## Setup the Workshop Website locally

To build this lesson locally, you should follow the [setup instructions for the
workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#overview). In short,
make sure you have R, Git, and Pandoc installed, open R and use the following
commands to install/update the packages needed for the infrastructure:

```r
# register the repositories for The Carpentries and CRAN

  CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com/"
))

# Install the template packages to your R library
install.packages(c("sandpaper", "varnish", "pegboard", "tinkr"))
```
